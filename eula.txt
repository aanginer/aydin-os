The main privacy concern for aydin-os is the MySql database connected to the OS. All information stored in the database can be accessed by the command line. If the user wishes to put sensitive information in the database, they must use the command line to access the database. The user must be careful to not use the command line to access sensitive information. To encrypt sensitive information, the user must use the password encryption software.
-----------------
shell
-> encrypt <your info here>
-> db post top 
----------------
This will post your sensitive info to the database encrypted. You may not use the command line to access sensitive information of other users. This includes passwords, which are stored in the database (encrypted). You may noy decrypt any encrypted information without permission from the person who encrypted it. If you would like to encrypt and decrypt your own information, see https://github.com/aanginer/aydinOS-docs/blob/master/readmes/encode.md for more information. Another concern is that the system files are easily accessed in the file explorer. To ensure nobody can access the system files, use the following on the command line:
-----------------
shell
-> fileapi -settings
-> set system_files_user sudo_ 
-> set top unchangable         <-------- ensures that this cannot be changed
-> end -settings
-> sudo disable user sudo_     <-------- disables the user sudo_, so the files cannot be accessed
----------------
to get back access to those files
-----------------
shell
-> new user sudo_
-> sudo enable user sudo_
-> password <enter password>
-> sudo delete new user
----------------
The process is quite complex, sorry about that. The reason system file access is not disabled by default is that it is very useful for software developers and modders to view game files or system files.

Hacking into aydin-os is allowed for educational purposes, and we encourage people learning to hack to use our software to understand things about databases. You may also decompile the code in whatever way you want, so long as you do not claim it as your own. You do not have to even decompile, as the software is open-source. You may not hack or decompile for malicious purposes such as creating a proxy to track whenever a new user signs up, then taking that users information (username and password). Any hacking will not be tolerated unless you are in development mode.
-----------------
shell
-> sudo mode dev
-> sudo set_user dev
